# The differences between Javascript and JQuery

## Javascript
> Javascript is one of the most simple, versatile and effective languages used to extend functionality in websites. Uses range from on screen visual effects to processing and calculating data on web pages with ease as well as extended functionality to websites using third party scripts among several other handy features.

### Advantages
* Javascript is executed on the client side, this means that the code is not executed on ghe web server, but the user's processor instead. This saves bandwidth and strain on the web server.
* Javascript is a relatively easy language. The Javascript language is relatively easy to learn and comprises of syntax that is close to English. It uses the DOM model that provides plenty of prewritten functionality to the various objects on pages. This makes it easy to learn an a easy to develop a script to make scripts for different purposes.
* Javascript is relatively fast to the end user, as the code is executed on the user's computer, results and processing is completed almost instantly depending on the task, as it does not need to be processed in the site's web server and sent back to the user consuming local as well as server bandwidth. 


### Disadvantages
*Security Issues. Javascript snippets, once appended onto web pages execute on client servers immediately and therefore can also be used to exploit the user's system. While a certain restriction is set by modern web standards on browsers, malicious code can still be executed complying with the restrictions set.
*Javascript rendering varies. Different layout engines may render Javascript differently resulting in inconsistency in terms of functionality and interface. While the latest versions of javascript and rendering have been geared towards a universal standard, certain variations still exist. Website Usability Consultants all over the world make a living on these differences, but it enrages thousands of developers on a daily basis.


## Jquery
> JQuery has been a blessing for several web developers, experienced and newbie alike. It is a library for Javascript that immensely simplifies programming with javascript providing very easy to use, condensed syntax to achieve even apparently complex tasks with Javascript. The use of JQuery has several benefits over using other javascript libraries or the raw javascript itself but it does have a few negative points that you might want to consider if you plan on developing a website with JQuery as well.

### Advantages

*The main advantage of using JQuery, it is a lot more easy to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries. Apart from simple syntax, it also requires much less lines of code to achieve the same feature in comparison.
*JQuery enables you to perform hordes of functions in comparison to other Javascript libraries. 
*JQuery, while relatively new, has a devoted following, using their time to develop and enhance the functionality of JQuery. Thus there are hundreds of prewritten plugins available for download to instantly speed up your development process. Another advantage behind this is the efficiency and security of the script.
*The JQuery website has a comprehensive documentation and tutorials to get even an absolute beginner in programming to get the ball rolling with this library.
*JQuery lets you develop Ajax templates with ease, Ajax enables a sleeker interface where actions can be performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded. A pretty but simple example of this can be seen above the fold on HowToRefinanceYourMortgage.net.

### Disadvantages
*While JQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require on your website, functionality maybe limited thus using raw javascript maybe inevitable in some cases.
*The JQuery javascript file is required to run JQuery commands, while the size of this file is relatively small (25-100KB depending on server), it is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the JQuery script on your own web server.
*Jquery gets a lot of updates, because of the committed following. because of this, some codes could get removed or edited. This can cause your codes to stop working.
